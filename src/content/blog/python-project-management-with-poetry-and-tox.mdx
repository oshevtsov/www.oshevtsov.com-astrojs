Python is a [very popular and widely
used](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-admired-and-desired) programming language. It is quite
versatile and easy to learn, which is why it is used in a very broad range of applications &ndash; from simple
scripts and CLI tools to IoT, web development, AI and machine learning, and scientific computing. Python has
been around [since 1991](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>), which feels like
forever given how much the world of technology has changed. This has its pros and cons. One the one hand,
Python has one of the largest ecosystems out there, with almost 500,000 packages on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
(as of time of this writing). On the other hand, some of the design decisions made at the beginning of its
development show that it is quite an old language.

One of the largest (if not the largest) pain point of all Python developers is the approach to dependency
management and packaging. Anyone I talk to describes its current state as: <q>it's a mess</q>. The reason for
this is the [myriad of tools that
exist](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/) to help solve some aspect of
the problem, with no established preferred solution, despite the existence of the so-called [Python Packaging
Authority (PyPa)](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/).

## Introduction

Here I describe one of the ways one can set up a Python project, using a combination of the tools I have
personally used at work. The setup I describe here has worked quite well for us so far, modulo some minor
gotchas to be aware of (see below).

As an example, I set up a command-line tool that accepts a textual input and a set of flags to display some
statistics about the input, such as: number of characters, number of words, and number of lines. This is far
from a complex business application, but should be enough for the demonstration purposes.

## Preparation

### Install Python

First things first. Since we are developing a Python application, you should have it installed on your system.
If you have a UNIX-based operating system you should already have it. If not I suggest to use your package
manager to install it (`dnf` on Fedora, `apt` on Debian-based distros, `homebrew` on MacOS, `chocolatey` or
Microsoft Store on Windows).

The [official language page](https://python.org) suggests to download and install a binary from the website,
but I do not recommend it since you will have to manually update it. Using a package manager instead does it
for you.

### Install pipx

The next tool I recommend to have if you plan working with Python seriously is
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). It may not be immediately obvious why this is needed, but let me
explain. Some of the tools (often command-line) you will use to set up and manage a Python project are written
in Python. Since every reasonably large Python project has a lot of dependencies (both direct and indirect),
you do not want them to pollute your global Python environment. To isolate every such Python-based executable
and only expose the binary to the user you need a tool like pipx. Every application installed with pipx lives
in its own isolated environment. Having said that, it is alright to install pipx itself into the global Python
environment.

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Note that Python 2 has been deprecated since January 1, 2020 and the command to invoke Python interpreter may
be `python` rather than `python3` on your system. You can always check the version by executing `python
--version`. If you want to use a particular version explicitly, use `python3.x` (where `x` is an integer).

### Install Poetry

Next, we can leverage pipx and install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) &ndash; a very versatile tool for
dependency management and packaging.

```shell
pipx install poetry
```

Poetry is one of the most popular and actively maintained tools, but the biggest criticism is its deviation
from [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) and [PEP 508](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/)
specifications, in particular specifying project dependencies. This does not impact user experience in any way
most of the time, so you should not worry about it. There are other tools that solve the same problem and are
compliant with the specifications, such as [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/), but they come with their
own issues and are less actively maintained.

### Install Tox

Most of the Python projects I worked on required a task runner. It is a tool that provides a unified
interface to run tests, make a project release, publish the release package, etc. As usual, there are multiple
tools that exist in the ecosystem, but one of the most used is [Tox](https://tox.wiki/). We can leverage pipx
again to install it.

```shell
pipx install tox
```

### Install Git

Finally, I highly recommend using a version control system, like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), on all of your
software projects. It is technically not required to set up a Python project, but it is so ubiquitous that
explaining the [benefits of using](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) it seems
unnecessary. Use your package manager to install Git. For example, with `dnf` you would run:

```shell
sudo dnf install git
```

## Sample Project: Text Stats

Let us go step-by-step with setting up a Python project for the text stats command-line tool mentioned above.
The final version of the source code is [available on
GitHub](https://github.com/oshevtsov/python-poetry-text-stats), if you are interested to have a look and
experiment yourself.

### Project Initialization

Poetry helps with bootstrapping a fresh Python project. All you have to do is run a command in your terminal.

```shell
poetry new --src text-stats
```

Here, the `--src` flag is used to initialize a project structure where all source code resides in a `src`
folder (de-facto default in most projects). You should see the following project structure.

```
text-stats/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── text_stats
│       └── __init__.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py
```

All the metadata describing the project, including dependencies, is specified inside the `pyproject.toml`
file. The `tests` folder is the default location for source code tests.

### Version Control

Change directory to the newly created project and initialize a Git repository.

```shell
cd text-stats
git init .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Before we move on, I recommend to set up a `.gitignore` file to avoid checking in temporary files into the
version control system. An easy way to generate the initial content of your `.gitignore` file is by using a
[web generator](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/). Go to the page, type `python` in the input
field and click on the "Create" button. Copy the content of the page and save it in the root of your project
under the name `.gitignore`. Finally, commit the change.

```shell
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
```

### Setup Tox

Next, we will bootstrap a configuration file for the task runner &ndash; Tox. It should already be installed
on your machine. So, run the following command in the root of your project:

```shell
tox quickstart .
```

This will generate a file called `tox.ini` that looks similar to this:

```ini
[tox]
env_list =
    py311
minversion = 4.11.3

[testenv]
description = run the tests with pytest
package = wheel
wheel_build_env = .pkg
deps =
    pytest>=6
commands =
    pytest {tty:--color=yes} {posargs}
```

Note that it already has a default task set up that runs unit tests with the tool called
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). I show how to use it later in the post, so bear with me. Now, you may go
on and commit the generated file.

```shell
git add tox.ini
git commit -m "Generate tox.ini file"
```

### Setup Linter, Formatter, Type Checker, and LSP Configuration

Note that we have gone pretty far without writing a single line of Python code yet. We are getting there, but
we should prepare our development environment to ensure consistent code style and default quality checks,
regardless how many people are going to collaborate on the project.

It is important to set up and agree on the configuration of these tools as early as possible to remove the
mental effort of thinking about how to format the code or how to avoid syntax errors. So, let's get started.
The tools we need are: linter, formatter, type checker, and (optionally, but very recommended) LSP server.

First, let us setup [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) &ndash; the de-facto standard linter for
Python. There are other, less mature, projects out there, like [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), that I
may cover in another post. Unlike other tools, at the time of writing flake8 [does not
support](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/234) configuration via `pyproject.toml`, but it can use
`tox.ini` instead. Open your `tox.ini` file and append the following section at the end:

```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 120
extend-ignore = E203, W503
exclude =
    .tox,
    .venv,
    build,
    dist,
    .eggs
```

You can read about the meaning and many more options in the official flake8 documentation, but we essentially
set it up to allow source code lines with less than 120 characters (a limit of 88 is often used, but I find it
too restrictive).

Next, let us set up code formatters. There are two tools we will use for code formatting:
[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). Both can be
configured via `pyproject.toml`. Open your `pyproject.toml` file and append the following at the end:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 120

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
src_paths = ["src", "tests"]
```

The reason we need two tools is that isort is used for formatting the import statements, while black is used
to format the rest of the code. It seems strange to make the split, but code formatting is only simple on the
surface. If you are familiar with Python import statements, you may know that arbitrarily shuffling the import
statements may change the behavior of your Python module. So, sorting imports may not be a mere cosmetic
change. Again, the line-length limit is set to 120 characters, in agreement with the linter.

Next, let us configure the type checker. Python is a dynamically typed language, which is both its strength
and its weakness. To mitigate the risk of incorrectly using data types, Python ecosystem has a tool called
[mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/). It is a static code analysis tool that leverages type annotations to reason
about the data types used in the code. Mypy is also configurable via `pyproject.toml`, append the following at
the end:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
strict = true
```

There are many more options you can set up, which you may find in the documentation.

Finally, let us configure [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), a tool that is developed by
Microsoft. It is called a type checker in the official repository, but it implements what is known as the
Language Server Protocol (LSP). The latter is a specification developed and maintained by Microsoft that
describes a generic way to develop language servers &ndash; software that powers common IDE features like auto
completion, go to definition, or documentation on hover. Pyright can also be configured in `pyproject.toml`,
append the following at the end:

```toml
[tool.pyright]
typeCheckingMode = "basic"
```

Check the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/) to see the full list of options. Commit you
changes and proceed.

```shell
git add -u
git commit -m "Configure flake8, black, isort, mypy, and pyright"
```

Note that I do not describe how to install and hook up the tools mentioned above to your preferred code editor
or IDE. This process depends on the editor of choice. In case of [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), this is powered by plugins that are straightforward to install. I am
personally a [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) user and may describe this process in more detail in a separate
post.

### Add Text Stats Module

Now it is time to implement the business logic of the command-line tool we are building. You may use
test-driven development (TDD) or write code first and tests later, it is up to you. For simplicity of the
explanation flow, let's assume that you start with the code. Activate the virtual environment for your project
with Poetry and install all dependencies.

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
```

The latter command will also install the project you are working on as
[editable](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) allowing you to
quickly iterate on the changes to the source code and tests. Now, create a new module with the following content:

```python
# text-stats/src/text_stats/stats.py
import re


def count_characters(input: str) -> int:
    """Count charactes in the input string (including whitespace and punctuation)"""
    return len(input)


def count_words(input: str) -> int:
    """Count words in the input string"""
    words = list(filter(lambda w: len(w) > 0, re.split(r"\W+", input)))
    return len(words)


def count_lines(input: str) -> int:
    """Count lines in the input string"""
    return len(input.splitlines())
```

This module implements the logic for counting the number of characters, words, and lines in the input string.
Our goal is to expose this functionality via a command-line interface to a user. Before we do that it is, of
course, a good practice to make sure the code is working as expected with the help of unit tests. Create a new
module in the `tests` folder.

```python
# text-stats/tests/tests_stats.py
import pytest

from text_stats.stats import count_characters, count_lines, count_words


@pytest.fixture
def input_special_symbols():
    return "$@&+-\n\n\t;:, "


@pytest.fixture
def input_one_word():
    return "abcd_123"


@pytest.fixture
def input_multiline():
    return "Hi, how are you?\nI am good, and you?"


# -----------------------------
# Test count_characters
# -----------------------------
def test_count_characters_empty_string():
    assert count_characters("") == 0


def test_count_characters_one_word(input_one_word: str):
    assert count_characters(input_one_word) == 8


def test_count_characters_special_symbols(input_special_symbols: str):
    assert count_characters(input_special_symbols) == 12


def test_count_characters_multiline(input_multiline: str):
    assert count_characters(input_multiline) == 36


# -----------------------------
# Test count_words
# -----------------------------
def test_count_words_empty_string():
    assert count_words("") == 0


def test_count_words_one_word(input_one_word: str):
    assert count_words(input_one_word) == 1


def test_count_words_special_symbols(input_special_symbols: str):
    assert count_words(input_special_symbols) == 0


def test_count_words_multiline(input_multiline: str):
    assert count_words(input_multiline) == 9


# -----------------------------
# Test count_lines
# -----------------------------
def test_count_lines_empty_string():
    assert count_lines("") == 0


def test_count_lines_one_word(input_one_word: str):
    assert count_lines(input_one_word) == 1


def test_count_lines_special_symbols(input_special_symbols: str):
    assert count_lines(input_special_symbols) == 3


def test_count_lines_multiline(input_multiline: str):
    assert count_lines(input_multiline) == 2
```

Note how we use pytest to set up fixtures. If you have the python language server set up, you may see an error
in your IDE that pytest import could not be resolved. Since this package is only needed during development it
should not be a regular dependency, but rather a development-time only. We can use Poetry again to fix it.

```shell
poetry add --group dev pytest
```

This will add pytest to a group of dependencies called `dev` that **does get installed** with `poetry
install`, but is not part of the production release. Now, use Tox to make sure that all test pass.

```shell
tox
```

You should see the output, part of which looks similar to the following:

```
collected 12 items

tests/test_stats.py ............                                                       [100%]

===================================== 12 passed in 0.01s =====================================
```

Commit the latest changes before proceeding.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Add stats module"
```

### Create Command-Line Interface

The business logic module is finished and we have to add the command-line interface to our application. Create
a new file in the `src` folder with the following content:

```python
# text-stats/src/text_stats/cli.py
from argparse import ArgumentParser

from text_stats.stats import count_characters, count_lines, count_words


def run():
    parser = ArgumentParser(description="Count character, words, lines in a text file")
    parser.add_argument("input", help="Text input")
    parser.add_argument("-c", "--characters", action="store_true", help="Count characters")
    parser.add_argument("-w", "--words", action="store_true", help="Count words")
    parser.add_argument("-l", "--lines", action="store_true", help="Count lines")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.characters:
        print(f"Number of characters: {count_characters(args.input)}")
    if args.words:
        print(f"Number of words: {count_words(args.input)}")
    if args.lines:
        print(f"Number of lines: {count_lines(args.input)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

This module use the built-in Python module `argparse` to parse the input arguments and call the appropriate
business logic. You can immediately check that it works by running this module.

```shell
python3 src/text_stats/cli.py -c -w -l "Hello, World!"
```

This should produce an output like this:

```
Number of characters: 13
Number of words: 2
Number of lines: 1
```

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to call this using a custom-named command? Poetry allows to do that with
scripts. All you have to do is add a section to your `pyproject.toml` like this:

```toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
text-stats = "text_stats.cli:run"
```

It specifies a path to a function to call inside the installed version of our project. You could say, "Wait a
minute. Isn't our project called `text-stats`, with a dash?". Yes, but the name of the package installed is
`text_stats`, see the following line in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
...
packages = [{include = "text_stats", from = "src"}]
```

This also tells you that a Poetry project may contain multiple packages. This would be like a monorepo setup
where you a common repository for a tightly related set of packages.

Anyway, we have defined a script called `text-stats` that calls the `run()` function for us. Poetry will make
sure this script is available when we install our package. Now, you can invoke our CLI as follows:

```shell
text-stats -c -w -l "Hello, World!"
```

Commit what we have done.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Add command-line interface"
```

### Example Dependency Usage

Finally, I want to show how you can leverage external dependencies in your project. After all, I have told you
that Poetry is good at that. Let us modify the command-line interface a little bit to display the statistics
with colors, using an external package called [print-color](https://pypi.org/project/print-color/).

```shell
poetry add print-color
```

After you run this command, it will pull and install print-color to you virtual environment, add it to the
list of dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, and update the `poetry.lock` file. I have not mentioned the lock
file yet. It is a plain-text file in TOML format that contains a snapshot of all the project dependencies
(both direct and indirect). It is recommended to keep the lock file under version control if you are
developing an application (as opposed to a library) as it allows to get more reproducible builds (see
[documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#committing-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control)
for more information).

With the dependency installed, we can modify the `cli.py` file as follows:

```python
# text-stats/src/text_stats/cli.py
from argparse import ArgumentParser

import print_color

from text_stats.stats import count_characters, count_lines, count_words


def run():
    parser = ArgumentParser(description="Count character, words, lines in a text file")
    parser.add_argument("input", help="Text input")
    parser.add_argument("-c", "--characters", action="store_true", help="Count characters")
    parser.add_argument("-w", "--words", action="store_true", help="Count words")
    parser.add_argument("-l", "--lines", action="store_true", help="Count lines")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if any([args.characters, args.words, args.lines]):
        print_color.print("Input stats:", format="bold")
    if args.characters:
        print_color.print(count_characters(args.input), tag="chars", tag_color="green")
    if args.words:
        print_color.print(count_words(args.input), tag="words", tag_color="yellow")
    if args.lines:
        print_color.print(count_lines(args.input), tag="lines", tag_color="red")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

Let us test how the output changed after this update. Run the following in your terminal to see:

```shell
text-stats -c -w -l "Hello, World!"
```

As usual, commit the latest changes.

```shell
git add -u
git commit -m "Add example dependency for colored printing"
```

## Release and Distribution

Before wrapping this (already long) post up, I want to briefly mention how you can build a release of your
Poetry project and give some advice on distributing it. This topic deserves a separate post, which I might
consider writing later. Python has two standard formats for distributing packages: wheel and sdist. The latter
is short for "source distribution", an older format that, as its name implies, is just a snapshot of the
project's source code as a `.tar.gz` archive. The former is the newer format introduced by [PEP
427](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) &ndash; ZIP-format archive with the `.whl` extension. The previous
sentence should give you a hint that you can use `unzip` command if you are curious about the content of the
wheel.

Building a release of a Poetry project is very straightforward.

```shell
poetry build
```

This will create a `dist` folder in the root of your project.

```
dist/
├── text_stats-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
└── text_stats-0.1.0.tar.gz

1 directory, 2 files
```

As you can see, by default both formats are produced. You can use `--format=[sdist|wheel]` to generate only
one, if you want. The `0.1.0` part of the name is the project version, as defined in the `pyproject.toml`
file.

Poetry allows you to publish the produced release artifacts to a PyPi registry &ndash; a repository of Python
packages, the most known one being the official [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/). After you [configure
your credentials for the repository](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#publishable-repositories),
publishing is as simple as running a single command.

```shell
poetry publish
```

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

Finally, I want to note that Poetry is a fantastic tool for local development, but may be quite heavy for the
CI/CD setups. The reason I say that is because it has quite a few dependencies and takes a while to install.
It is certainly possible to have a container image with Poetry pre-installed, but many teams use default Linux
images for their pipelines and install Poetry as a preparation step. For these situations I recommend using
lighter tools, such as [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/) (to generate a release) and
[twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) (for publishing). It is quite straightforward to invoke these tools
as Tox tasks, creating a unified interface for the pipelines (you would use `tox -e build` and `tox -e
publish` at the corresponding CI/CD stages).

## Summary

In this blog post I have shown how you can start using Poetry for your Python projects. I went a bit beyond
general introduction and discussed how you can configure important developer productivity tools, such as
linters, formatters, type checkers, and a language server. Comprehensive coverage of all aspects of a Python
project life cycle would require a much longer post, so I may cover these topics in separate articles.
