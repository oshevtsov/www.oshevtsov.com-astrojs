At the end of each year, as probably many other people, I start thinking about what I
want to do in the upcoming year. The year 2021 was no different. "This year is gonna be
a fresh start," I told myself, "this is the beginning of something new - a new
chapter." I hope it will be, and I shared my thoughts below.

## New website

In 2022, I finally decided to create my website. I have done this before for other
people and organizations but somehow never made one for myself. Now, the time felt just
right to do it. This website is my first attempt at kicking it off. It is still a work
in progress, but I wanted to put it out there and make incremental improvements when I
find time for it. Starting is the hardest part, but this milestone is already achieved,
given that you are reading this ðŸ˜‰.

The purpose of the website is two-fold. On the one hand, I want to establish a better
online presence as a software engineering professional. It seems to gradually become a
must-have in the post-COVID19 world when remote work is a new norm and getting to know
people online is a casualty. On the other hand, I want to use the website, and this
blog, in particular, to structure my thoughts and preserve the pieces of information on
various topics that I find exciting and interesting.

## Personal blog

I tend to spend a lot of my free time learning new skills, reading books, and thinking,
but consuming information in a way that would also retain it long-term is not easy. One
of the goals I set for myself when I decided to have a blog on the website was to have
a structured, easy-to-access, available everywhere place where I can write in my own
words about the topics which interest me. The initial intention was to have the
articles available for future reference. If I manage to attract external readers, this
will be a great bonus, of course ðŸ˜ƒ.

Another motivation I had to create the blog was to improve my communication skills. In
the modern world, where predicting the future is a hopeless task, it is important to be
future-proof. What I mean by this is that trends and technologies change all the time,
but there are fundamental skills and abilities which will serve you well in any
situation:

- speaking and writing
- problem-solving
- learning

Until now, I have worked on all of the above, with a greater focus on problem-solving
and learning. I hope that having this blog will allow me to improve my writing skills.
Regular writing has a lot of significant side effects besides the obvious benefit of
becoming a better writer.

I may like it to such an extent that I will consider becoming a content creator
full-time. Only time will tell. With great hopes for this new project, I wish myself
luck!
