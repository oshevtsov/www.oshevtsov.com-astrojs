As another year has passed, I have decided to give my blog a new life. At the beginning
of last year I announced that I had started a blog. Ironically, this was the first and
the last blog post that I wrote ever since.

## Year 2022 in retrospective

### War in Ukraine

Last year my home country became a focus of the news all around the globe. I wish it
was because of achievements in sports or science, but unfortunately it was because of a
war. Last year, on February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine. It was one of those days I wish
never happened. I remember waking up from a messenger call from my parents telling us
that Russian troops had crossed the border and moved towards the capital &mdash; Kyiv.

Since then, there has not been a single day that I didn't wake up or go to bed without
watching the news and supporting the Ukrainian army. I am lucky to not experience this
myself as I am an expat living in Sweden. However, both my wife and I, have parents in
Ukraine and we still feel strong bonds with this country. Many of my childhood friends
are now at the front line in Donbass region protecting our home country from the
Russian horde.

Just like millions of people in Ukraine, we had a lot of hopes and dreams at the
beginning of 2022, but it all changed when the war started. Since then we have
participated and organized numerous manifestations, donated money, and sent
humanitarian help to Ukraine. In one month, there will be a one-year anniversary since
this bloody war started. There are no illusions anymore for a quick happy ending, but
I strongly believe that Ukraine will break free from the Russian occupation, and I
really hope that this time next year I will write a post about it as a fact.

### My 2022

Even though the war in Ukraine occupied a large chunk of my time and mental resources,
there were a few important events that happened in my own life. Having worked in a few
large corporate environments, I decided to try something different. Last year I found a
new job at a small company in Stockholm called [Helicon](https://helicon.ai). This was
a rather unexpected move. I knew I wanted something new, but instead of applying for
open positions myself I first went through the unread messages from recruiters on
LinkedIn. Most of them did not contain anything interesting, but I replied to a few. I
was quite sceptical, I must say, even after I spoke to the recruiter hiring for
Helicon. But he convinced me to meet the company owners. Fast-forward a few weeks, I
signed a contract with my current employer.

The next big thing that happened was a move from Gothenburg to Stockholm. Global
economy crisis and increasing interest rates did not necessary play in my favor. My
wife and I spent quite a few evenings weighing all pros and cons of making this
decision. We decided to give it a shot. We knew we wanted a change in our life and a
move to a new place could be a great opportunity for the new start. It was quite
stressful because we had to sell our apartment in Gothenburg and buy new one in
Stockholm. It put a lot of pressure on our economy, but with careful planning we have
managed to go though it.

## Hopes for the new year

This year, in spite of all the obstacles and problems, I really hope to get back the
dreams and hopes that were stolen by the war. It is going to be a year of change, and
the change is going to be of the scale never seen before. I will continue to support
our relatives in Ukraine, support and believe in the Ukrainian army.

Even more than in previous years, I am hungry for knowledge and I am going to invest
time in self-education and my family. Finally, I hope that my original
intention to start writing to this blog on a regular basis will come true. Let's go!
